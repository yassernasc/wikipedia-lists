** Context

The year was 2018 and Wikipedia released [[https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2018/05/25/synced-reading-lists/][Synced reading lists for its mobile apps]], but what about the Browser and Desktop? 5 years later, the [[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Reading_list_browser_extension][official extension]] remains pretty minimalist.

I have found Wikipedia's Reading Lists to be a wonderful way to organize research. And not being able to manage them on my main work device was the primary motivation for developing the extension. And I truly hope this extension can be useful to other people as well.

** Principles

- *Full-featured*, the extension aims to cover all features from mobile apps, and possibly go further.
- *Privacy-friendly*, no information is stored anywhere by extension's domains.
- *Fair user experience*, the extension follows the [[https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/][Wikipedia's Design Style Guide]].
